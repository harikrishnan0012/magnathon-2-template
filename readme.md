## Project Title
## Sustainable Water Management: Integrating Technology for Enhanced Monitoring and Location Tagging

In today's world, access to clean water is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people around the globe lack access to safe drinking water. The scarcity of clean water sources, coupled with inadequate sanitation facilities, poses significant health risks and hinders socio-economic development, particularly in underserved communities. To address this pressing challenge, our project aims to revolutionize water management through the deployment of an innovative IoT solution that enhances access to clean water and improves sanitation practices.
Our project involves the development and implementation of an IoT-based hardware and software system that integrates sensor technology, data analytics, and mobile applications to monitor water quality, track water distribution, and promote sustainable water management practices. The system comprises two main components: a network of smart sensors installed in water sources and distribution points, and a user-friendly mobile application for real-time monitoring and management.
